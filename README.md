Sorry about the poor README! See [!./intentions-wallpaper.sh](./intentions-wallpaper.sh) for a commented shell script.

Install [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org/) and copy all files in this directory to your own hard drive to reproduce this.

Thanks to [Ben Morton](https://www.ben-morton.com/) for all the advice!
